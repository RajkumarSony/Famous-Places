# Mahabalipuram- Avinash

## About Tourist Place 
Mamallapuram was one of two major port cities in the Pallava kingdom. The town was named after Pallava king Narasimhavarman I, 
who was also known as Mamalla. Along with economic prosperity, it became the site of a group of royal monuments, many carved out 
of the living rock. These are dated to the 7th and 8th centuries: rathas (temples in the form of chariots), mandapas (cave sanctuaries), 
the giant open-air rock relief the Descent of the Ganges, and the Shore Temple dedicated to Shiva. The contemporary town plan was 
established by the British Raj in 1827.
