## About Their Foods
Barramundi is a quintessential Australian fish that’s served in restaurants all over the country but is particularly common in Sydney. Native to Australia and the Indo-Pacific, barramundi is a hardy species. They’re naturally high in heart-healthy Omega-3 fatty acids and can be easily farmed without the use of antibiotics or hormones.

They’re also a great source of lean protein with a gentle, mild flavour and toothsome texture, and it’s virtually impossible to overcook. Like common types of whitefish, barramundi lacks a strong odour and can be used in a variety of recipes.
