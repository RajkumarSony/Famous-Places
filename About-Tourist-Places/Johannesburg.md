## About Tourist Place 
Colloquially popular as the ‘city of gold’, Johannesburg is the biggest city in South Africa that has mostly been known for being Nelson Mandela’s home or for its astonishing museums. But, there’s more to the city than meets the eye. There are places to visit in Johannesburg like Zoo Lake and Market Theatre that would change anyone’s opinion about the city being an attraction only for the history buffs.

## About Their Foods
Pap, a softly cooked maize-meal, is a main staple in South African food history, especially in the interior plateau region where Johannesburg is located. Short for mieliepap, (maize porridge), it comes from the Bantu tribes (Nguni and Sotho-Tswana) that migrated from West Africa around 2,000 years ago and introduced agriculture to the south when it was mostly populated by hunters, foragers, and gatherers. The Bantu people cultivated a variety of crops such as maize, sorghum, millet, and vegetables, and kept herds of domestic cattle. Pap is served alongside anything from meaty stews to braai meat to creamy spinach. It was traditionally cooked for large gatherings in three-legged iron pots on an open fire. Today, it’s still the staple of choice for any dinner or gathering. Even fast-food retailers such as KFC have incorporated it into their menus here. Being able to make pap is an essential life skill in Johannesburg, and what constitutes as a good plate of pap varies with the individual’s taste in thickness and texture. Most Joburgers prefer it to be quite soft, using the palms of their hands to roll it up into little balls.

Pap is everywhere in Johannesburg, you don’t have to look for it. When visiting the local restaurants and shisanyamas—barbecues—around town, request your main meal with pap.
