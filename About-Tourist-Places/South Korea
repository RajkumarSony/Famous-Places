## About Tourist Place 
South Korea, an East Asian nation on the southern half of the Korean Peninsula, shares one of the world’s most heavily 
militarized borders with North Korea. It’s equally known for its green, hilly countryside dotted with cherry trees and 
centuries-old Buddhist temples, plus its coastal fishing villages, sub-tropical islands and high-tech cities such as Seoul, 
the capital.
While only 60 years ago South Korea was considered a developing country, it’s now one of Asia’s economic and cultural 
leaders. Super-chic Seoul combines modernism with ancient history; coastal Busan serves up rugged beach spots; and Jeju 
Island wows with volcanic landscapes and towering mountains.
