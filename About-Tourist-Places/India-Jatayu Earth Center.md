## Background/Origins
The park located near the town of Chadayamangalam (Jatayumangalam), which was named for Jatayu. Jatayu was a demi-god in Ramayana (a Hindu epic) who had the form of a vulture.
According to the epic, Ravana was attempting to abduct Sita to Lanka when Jatayu tried to rescue her. Jatayu fought valiantly with Ravana, but as Jatayu was very old Ravana soon defeated him, clipping his wings, and Jatayu fell onto the rocks in Chadayamangalam. Rama and Lakshmana while on the search for Sita, chanced upon the stricken and dying Jatayu, who informed them of the battle with Ravana and told them that Ravana had headed South.
