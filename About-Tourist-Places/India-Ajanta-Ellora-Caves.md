# Ajanta Ellora Caves - Chaitanya K

## About Tourist Place 

The famous monumental Ajantha Ellora Caves were built between the 5th and 10th centuries by Buddhist, Jain, and Hindu monks, and make for an excellent excursion from Mumbai, some 300 kilometers to the west. 

Now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, this remarkable collection of 34 carved monasteries, chapels, and temples – 12 of them Buddhist, 17 Hindu, and five belonging to the Jain faith – were built in close proximity to each other, a reflection of the religious tolerance that existed during this period of Indian history.

Of the Buddhist monastery caves, highlights include a number of shrines featuring carvings of Buddha and saints dating from the 5th to 7th centuries, as well as the stunning Carpenter's Cave, considered one of the finest in India.

The Hindu caves are much more complex and were carved from the top down, so scaffolding was not necessary. Of these, the best is the Kailasa Temple, an enormous rock-cut temple representing Mount Kailasa and requiring the removal of 200,000 tons of rock.

## About Their Foods

While you are exploring the caves of Ajanta and Ellora, you cannot be bothered to have a proper meal as you need a walk a good amount in the sun. Hence, what works well is a light meal and lots of liquids. But, when you return to your accommodation in Aurangabad after your day trip, that is when you can look to recover all those lost calories by indulging in the best vegetarian thali meal in the whole of Aurangabad. And the perfect place to have such a great thali meal is Bhoj Thali restaurant, an iconic name in the Aurangabad dining circuit. Serving a mix of Rajasthani and Gujarati cuisines, their colorful, tasty and rich thali takes you on a quick trip to culinary heaven. Their menu seems to change every day, but the number of items on your plate usually remain the same. My favorites in this thali meal are the sweet kadhi, jowar roti with jaggery and ghee, masala khichdi and the rich ghee dessert. These items and the entire meal are a perfect way to celebrate your day and prepare yourself for another action packed day in the sun climbing historic sites and gorgeous locations. A highly recommended meal during your Ajanta Ellora trip.
