# Araku Valley - 1nsaan

## About Tourist Place 
Owing to its calm  and relaxed air Araku is Vizag's favourite weekend getaway. It is also the most famous hill station in all of Andhra Pradesh as the state doesn't have terrain of this kind in many other places. The small hill station which is actually a valley, is nestled & amidst the Ananthagiri Hills of the Eastern Ghats and has several natural wonders located closeby. The Borra Caves are worth visiting for their spectacular stalactites and stalagmites. The area also has several coffee plantations and museums.

The three hour long train journey from Vizag to Araku is also worth considering the train passes hills, valley, bridges, waterfalls and several tunnels before it reaches the Araku station.
