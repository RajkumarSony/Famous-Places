## About Tourist Place 
The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that extends 7,300 kilometers (4,500 miles) from the Shanhai Pass on the east coast to the Jiayu Pass in modern Gansu province. It has a history of over 2,300 years, beginning in the Spring and Autumn Period (770â€“476 BC). The most remaining today was built in the Ming Dynasty about 600 years ago.   
The Great Wall was originally conceived by Emperor Qin Shi Huang in the third century B.C. as a means of preventing incursions from barbarian nomads. Its purpose was to protect China from outside aggression, but also to preserve its culture from the customs of foreign barbarians.   
The total length of the Great Wall is 21196.18 km.
It took over 2,000 years to construct the wall.
There are 15 strategic passes from the East to the West.
It was constructed from the 7th Century BC by the Chu State and lasted until 1878 in the Qing Dynasty.
It's one of the world's most popular tourist attractions, with more than 10 million people visiting each year.
