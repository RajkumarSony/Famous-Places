# Name of Tourist Place - Your Name
Warsaw - Milena

## About Tourist Place 
Warsaw. One city, two faces
Each city has a place that is its showcase and a must-see on any trip. In Warsaw, it’s the Old Town, entered on the UNESCO World Heritage List – it’s where the city’s heart has been beating for centuries. However, when you cross the Vistula River and look at the Old Town from a distance, you are struck by how unusual the panorama of the city is – skyscrapers rise above the red roofs of the Old Town. Historical buildings blend in harmoniously with modern architecture, and the city surprises us by revealing its second face.

## About Their Foods
Warsaw cuisine is like the city: diverse, multicultural, delectable and full of energy. Book a table at a Michelin-star restaurant or experience the atmosphere of the communist era in a so-called milk bar. Allow yourself to be seduced by local desserts like W-Z cake, zygmuntówka, or organic ice cream. Take a peek at a breakfast fair, sit on the grass, and celebrate food. Apart from the classic Polish specialities that we describe below, Warsaw restaurants have dishes from all corners of the world, as well as vegetarian and gluten-free cuisine.
