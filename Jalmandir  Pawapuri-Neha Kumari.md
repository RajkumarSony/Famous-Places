Write some paragraph here...
The Jal Mandir or Water Temple is situated in[1] Pawapuri (also known as Apapapuri which means a town without sins),[2] in the Indian state of Bihar. It is a major pilgrimage destination of Jains and the temple is dedicated to Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara (religious preacher of Jainism), which marks the place of his cremation. Mahavira attained Nirvana (death) in Pawapuri in 527 BC.[3][4][5] The temple was originally built by King Nandivardhan, elder brother of Mahavira, within the pond which is filled with red coloured lotus flowers.[6] It is one of the five main temples in Pawpuri, where the "Charan Paduka" or foot impression of Mahavira is deified
