                    <p>
                        Look for spicy dishes flavoured with tamarind and coconut in Kochi, and don’t be surprised if

                        traditional Kochi cuisine employs the fruit in many dishes, both sweet and savoury. Coconut
                        water provides a refreshing and sweet contrast to the piquant food.
