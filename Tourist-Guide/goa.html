                        50km to see Mangeshi temple and found it to be just another ordinary temple. It can be highly
                        avoidable for tourism purpose. Your precious time can be spent on other things. Note : Please

                    <p>
                        Food is a major attraction in Goa. This part of India has a distinctive cuisine that blends
                        Portuguese and Goan flavors, setting it apart from all the other food around India. Expect fiery
                        flavors, fresh-caught seafood, and an abundance of coconut in
                        the dishes. You can't leave Goa without trying its signature dish, vindaloo, a super-hot meat
                        curry made with palm vinegar and dried red chili peppers. Hospedaria Venite in the capital of
                        Goa, Panaji, wows tourists with its mouthwatering
                        vindaloo. Dominick, a Benaulim Beach mainstay, is another favorite spot for vindaloo – plus it
                        offers front-row seats for world-class sunsets. Another Goan specialty is xacuti, a rich curry
                        with poppy seeds, chili, and coconut.
                        Try it at Souza Lobo, a beachfront restaurant in Calangute, or Fat Fish, a well-trafficked spot
                        in Baga. Tourists hankering for some fresh seafood are spoiled for choice around Goa. Zeebop, on
                        Utorda Beach, offers delightful fish
                        curry, prawn stew, and mackerel doused with spicy red sauce.
