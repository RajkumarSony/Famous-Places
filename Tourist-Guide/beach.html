                            When in doubt, go Goa! One cannot really go wrong with India’s party capital. A place where
                            people can be seen sunbathing, swimming, parasailing or relaxing in their hammocks sipping a
                            cold beer all year round, Goa is my first pick. In fact, Goa is the best place to kick-start
                            your beach blast in advance with Sunburn Goa this December! Sunburn is when a conglomerate
                            of party mongers and DJs from all over the world get together at the Candolim beach for the
                            grandest New Year beach party. Late night parties, hypnotic music and people dancing away;
                            Sunburn exponentially increases the fun quotient.

                            Gokarna in Karnataka is situated 190 kilometres south of Goa and makes for a wonderful
                            change from Goa’s fast pace! Famous for the Mahabaleshwar temple and its pristine beaches,
                            in this tranquil town, you can enjoy a day basking in the sun or laying in a hammock reading
                            a book without distractions. Gokarna is well-connected to major cities through buses and
                            trains and the closest airport is Dabolim Airport in Goa. Though an important pilgrimage
                            site, Gokarna blends religion with beach fun. Om Beach, Paradise Beach and Half-Moon Beach
                            are the famous ones, which have both fine sand and rocky coasts mostly untouched by
                            commercial activities.

                            making it ideal for swimming. Ganpatipule can be visited en route to Ratnagiri and is just
                            35 kilometres from the famous Jaigad Fort, which offers a panoramic view of the sea and
                            villages from the cliff. Ganpatipule is also famous for the Swaymbhu Ganesh temple where
                            Lord Ganesh’s statue is believed to have originated from the ground.

                            One of the best known places in India for meditation and relaxation, Pondicherry or
                            Puducherry is famous as India’s French connection. The erstwhile French colony retains
                            French culture and architecture and is definitely a unique place to visit. Famous for the
                            Sri Aurobindo Ashram in neighbouring Auroville where thousands go to seek solace, a
                            well-maintained waterfront is just completes the package of a beach holiday. Beach
                            activities in Pondicherry include camping at the beach, sunbathing, canoeing, kayaking and
                            backwater sailing.

                            Vizag or Visakhapatnam has plenty to offer a tourist for relaxation like beautiful beaches,
                            lakes, gardens and museums. The Ram Krishna Beach is ideal for spending evenings where one
                            can stroll down the beach or along pedestrian tracks that lead to beautiful parks and open
                            air restaurants. Book a cottage at the beautiful Rishikonda beach for a comfortable stay
                            right at the beach. Also visit Kailasagiri, a well-maintained hilltop that offers a
                            panoramic view of the sea.

                            is a popular beach with golden sand and a gentle slope that makes it ideal for swimming and
