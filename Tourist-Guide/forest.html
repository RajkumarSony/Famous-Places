                            Located in a central region of Madhya Pradesh, Kanha National Park is the largest National
                            Park in central India and has been ranked as one of the best parks in Asia. Among the 22
                            species of large mammals, the royal Bengal tigers are one of the major attractions. One of
                            the best tiger reserves in India, the present-day area stretches over the 940-kilometre
                            square which is divided into two sanctuaries: Hallon and Banjar.

                            The park was established in the year 1955 and has since actively contributed to the
                            preservation of many endangered species. The National Park was taken under the Project Tiger
                            Reserve in 1974. Abundant in flora and fauna, the Kanha National Park houses one of the
                            rarest species of deer- the Barasingha.

                            Mawphlang, home to Meghalaya's Sacred Forest, is a beautiful village situated 25 kilometres
                            away from Shillong, the capital city of the north-east Indian state of Meghalaya. The
                            village lies in the district of East Khasi Hills and is famous for its sacred groves. The
                            village is named Mawphlang as it is one of the several monoliths in the Khasi Hills. The
                            name Mawphlang means Grassy Stone (Maw phlang) and is a land of legendary stories,
                            sacrifices and unique culture. For the ones who want a glimpse of the tradition, culture and
                            lifestyle of the Khasis that is fading away in the modern world, Mawphlang is the place to
                            visit.
